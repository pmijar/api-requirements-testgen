# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with a valid email and password in the request body. It then checks that the response status code is 200, which indicates a successful login according to the provided OpenAPI spec. 

# Please replace the placeholders in the url, username, and password fields with your actual data.

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 200, "Login was not successful"
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with valid credentials and checks if the response status code is 200, which indicates a successful login. If the status code is not 200, the test will fail and print "Login was not successful". 

# Please replace 'http://localhost/login', 'valid_username', and 'valid_password' with your actual URL and valid credentials.

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 401
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the "/login" endpoint with invalid credentials and asserts that the response status code is 401, indicating unauthorized access. Please replace the URL with your actual API URL.

    assert response.status_code == 401
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the "/login" endpoint with an empty "username" field and a valid "password" field. It then checks that the response status code is 401, indicating that the request was unauthorized.

# Here is a Python pytest test function using the requests library:

    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 401, "Expected status code to be 401, but it was {}".format(response.status_code)
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the "/login" endpoint with a JSON payload where the password field is empty. It then checks that the response status code is 401, which indicates that the request was unauthorized. If the status code is not 401, the test fails and prints a message indicating the actual status code.

    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 401, "Expected status code 401, but got {}".format(response.status_code)
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with empty username and password fields. It then checks if the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized), which is the expected behavior when both fields are empty. If the status code is not 401, the test will fail and print the actual status code received.

    assert response.status_code == 200, "Expected status code to be 200, but got {}".format(response.status_code)
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with a payload containing special characters in the username and password fields. It then checks if the response status code is 200, which indicates a successful login. If the status code is not 200, the test will fail.

# Please replace the URL "http://localhost:5000/login" with the actual URL of your API.

    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    assert response.status_code != 500, "Server should not crash with long string inputs"
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with a long string as the username and password. It then checks that the server does not return a 500 status code, which would indicate a server error. If the server is correctly handling long string inputs, it should not crash and return a 500 status code.

# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with an invalid email format and checks if the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized), which indicates that the login was rejected. 

# Please replace "http://localhost/login" with the actual URL of your API. Also, note that this test assumes that your API is using HTTP status code 401 to indicate unauthorized access. If your API uses a different status code for this case, please adjust the test accordingly.

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

    assert response.status_code == 401, "Expected status code to be 401, but it was {}".format(response.status_code)
# ```

# This test function sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with a password that does not meet the minimum requirements. It then checks if the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized), which indicates that the login was rejected. If the status code is not 401, the test fails and an assertion error is raised.
